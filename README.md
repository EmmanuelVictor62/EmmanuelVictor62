### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Emmanuel, a Full-Stack Software Developer who builds with intent. Over the years, I’ve contributed to platforms that impact thousands, led engineering teams, and written code that powers seamless user experiences across web and mobile.

I thrive in fast-paced environments and love crafting scalable, maintainable systems. Lately, I’ve been deepening my understanding of **Machine Learning** and **DevOps**, pushing beyond traditional software boundaries.

All built with Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL for performance and scalability.

####  **Bedspace**
Led backend and UI/UX teams for a student accommodation platform—designed RESTful APIs, planned infrastructure, and ensured consistent UI/UX across the board.

####  **Vidaxhelps (Portugal)**
